* Description

This repository contains the experiments carried out for automated generation of safety proofs with Rewriting Modulo SMT integrated with the Soft-Agent's framework.

Details can be found at the paper:
Automating Safety Proofs about Cyber-Physical Systems using Rewriting Modulo SMT.

* Dependencies

* Experiments

At the root directory, there are several maude files with prefix load-platooning.
These files load the necessary files to carry out the experiments.

The commands used as well as the results are detailed in the file experiments.maude.
