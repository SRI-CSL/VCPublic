This is the implementation reported in our submission to FCSD22

On the Formalization and Complexity of Resilience Problems for Cyber-Physical Systems

It is constructed on top of the Soft Agents framework.
Details about the Soft Agent framework, please refer to the paper [1].

You also need to download the Maude engine from [2].

The experiments can be found in the file:

Models/DronesRes/experiments-simple.maude

To load the machinery, just:

  cd Models/DroneRes
  maude load-mp
  Maude> load experiments-simple.maude

Then starting at line 31 of the file experiments-simple.maude, you can run the search commands with the different experiments.

For example:

search [1] {iC(easyTargets,mvHigh,easyDeadline)} =>+ asys:ASystem such that not goalAchieved(easyDeadline,asys:ASystem) .

checks the resilience property an UAV carry out an easy mission, with easy deadline when there is a single update mvH.
